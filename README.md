# Decrypting the Stock Market

Cryptocurrencies offer a new and appealing way for investors to make potentially large gains through a decentralized, digital fiat currency that is also relatively easy to use. The market for these digital currencies, though, has been plagued by extreme volatility, making investment in these currencies risky at best. However, with the recent rise of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies have moved away from being a fringe asset and have managed to carve their own place in the market. As such, we would like to create a database in order to examine stock market trends and compare them to trends in certain cryptocurrency markets. 

In creating this SQL database using the ensuing datasets, we hope that end-users will be able to gather relevant data across both stock and cryptocurrency markets and utilize this data for analyzing overarching  market trends. Further, we hope that some correlation can be drawn between both markets in order to alleviate some of the apparent volatility of the cryptocurrency market and make investing in this potentially lucrative market less risky.
